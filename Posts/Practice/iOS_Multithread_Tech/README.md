## Preface

在 iOS 中实现多线程（Multithread）通常有以下几种方式，`pthread` 


# POSIX Threads (pthreads)

> POSIX Threads, usually referred to as pthreads, is an execution model that exists independently from a language, as well as a parallel execution model. It allows a program to control multiple different flows of work that overlap in time. Each flow of work is referred to as a thread, and creation and control over these flows is achieved by making calls to the POSIX Threads API.

> POSIX（Portable Operating System Interface of UNIX，可移植操作系统接口）线程，即 pthreads，是一种不依赖于编程语言的执行模型和并行执行模型。其允许一个程序控制多个时间重叠的不同工作流。每个工作流即为一个线程，通过调用 POSIX 线程 API 创建并控制这些流。
